Predicting patient outcomes, understanding care costs, and incentivizing quality care are the three core components of value-based care models. Together, they will be configured in a way unlike traditional fee-for-service models. The hard reality about our future business model illustrates how current EHR isn’t likely set up for to support it.  Here’s why.

Payers want providers to migrate to value-based care for very specific reasons:

* Payers need better control over how to balance insurance premium income to claims.  
* By tying payment amounts directly with performance, as the theory holds, improved access and better health outcomes will ultimately be realized.

This means accounting for “risk”. In the future, the best-in-class providers must be prepared to be accountable for their portion of risk – the risk they can control by better understanding how their skills affect outcomes. To make this new model work, here’s the three components YOUUniverse offers providers to help solve the problem:

* Value is created by understanding your actual costs of delivering care, understanding the product of care – or outcomes, and predicting catastrophic “risk” (paying out more than they receive in premiums from their members).
