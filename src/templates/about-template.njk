                The YOUUniverse is a part of a family of healthy community health platforms. We serve many vertical applications and all
                acuities from hospitalization, partial hospitalization, outpatient, continuing care and lifestyle communities that
                encourage treatment, prevention and personal development.

                These communities are part of three important health segments; mental and behavioral health and personal development. We
                serve people who need clinical assistance with a life-controlling issue or non-clinical community management for
                self-improvement and personal growth.

                hyper-connect other communities to build the size, scope and revenue opportunity large markets have to offer. If you’re
                a single physician, or a multi-state clinical operator, a church, a university or virtual community, we’ve got an
                easy-to-use solution for “youu”.
