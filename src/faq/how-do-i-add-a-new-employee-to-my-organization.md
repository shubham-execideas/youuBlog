question: How do I add a new employee to my organization?

description: Center administrators can add employees using the web portal under
  the Admin tab. If you do not see the admin tab, chances are that your
  organization has not provided you with the prerequisite permissions. Please
  contact your center admin to have your permissions adjusted, or reach out to
  our chat agent if you need help figuring out who has the required permissions
  on your side.
