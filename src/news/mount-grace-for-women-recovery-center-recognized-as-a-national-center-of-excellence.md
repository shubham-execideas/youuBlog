“We’re grateful for the tool of Sober Peer here at Mount Grace for Women. It has enhanced not only our inpatient program, but our aftercare as well. We’re able to stay directly connected to the students in the third phase of our program through Sober Peer, and it also keeps a coach readily available to them,” said Mount Grace for Women Director Jessica Arcement. “At Mount Grace, we feel connection to a support system is one of the keys to living a drug free life, and Sober Peer is the tool that has connected us to them directly. We are grateful for Sober Peer!”\

According to Mark Cole, Sober Peer’s Chief Operating Officer, “Mount Grace has managed to enhance their client experience by engaging them with Sober Peer’s Digital Health toolsets using targeted posts, group and individual chats and by responding to client comments at a disciplined and higher rate of client interaction than most programs. That contributed to superior outcome results from a well-run program that sees value in process measurement.”\
