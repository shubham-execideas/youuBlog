Sober Peer measures a patient’s progress in 12 different behaviors every day as part of our “Measures and Milestones” dashboard. One of these categories is titled “Work,” which enables a clinician to determine if the patient is making progress as part of their recovery.

New data from a large treatment center in the Northeast shows that 50 patients using Sober Peer made impressive gains in the Work category.

The group of 50 people started out with a combined score of 25 on a 100-point scale– which is extremely low.  But after only three months, they scored 75.5.  The 188 percent increase in the Work category was the best improvement in the 12 categories measured by our dashboard.

“By monitoring a patient’s work status, clinicians can use data from our dashboard to see a patient’s progress and adapt their treatment plan,” says Mark Cole, Sober Peer’s chief operating officer. “The data is one more way our platform can help provide the shortest path to recovery at the lowest cost.”

The score is based largely on the automated collection of data completed daily by each patient. Using artificial intelligence support within our platform, these “Sober Signals” collect and analyze up to 500 pieces of data to gain deeper insights about each patient.
