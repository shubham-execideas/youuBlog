DALLAS, TX, USA, March 22, 2023 /[EINPresswire.com](http://www.einpresswire.com/)/ -- [YOUU Health](http://youu.com/) announced today that its fine-tuned behavioral health dataset using GPT-3.5 will be upgraded immediately to GPT-4 upon its commercial release from Microsoft Azure in early April 2023. YOUU Health joins other existing priority users to be the first to support this new large language generative AI model.\
\
“With today’s announcement of GPT-4 by the Azure OpenAI Service we are production-ready to begin immediately applying the most advanced AI model yet for use in our [YOUUniverse Health Cloud](https://youu.com/slider/preparing-you-for-a-new-care-model-/)platform”, said Ed DeShields, President and CEO of YOUU Health.\
\
The YOUUniverse Health Cloud is a full-stack healthcare platform specifically designed for behavioral healthcare. Its extensive use of augmented intelligence and digital health technology reimagines the traditional healthIT and electronic healthcare record systems (EHRs) that often create an administrative burden on healthcare workers.\
\
Using over 7 million days of fine-tuned behavioral health observations, the YOUUniverse uses [these new capabilities](https://youu.com/blog/9-most-important-integrations-are-ahead-for-augmented-intelligence-here%E2%80%99s-the-list/) for human-assisted insight on risk prevention, intervention, diagnostics support and practice management among other uses. It has been proven to improve the delivery of behavioral health thus making care measurably more efficient and effective.\
\
Mark Cole, YOUU Health’s Chief Operating Officer commented, “our pre-testing of GPT-4 fine-tuned data layer is an order of magnitude improvement in data science that will drive better outcomes and lower healthcare costs.”\
\
