title: "We spent 5 million hours engineering AI to work with Behavioral Health: Demo"
description: The article describes the process of engineering artificial
  intelligence (AI) to work with behavioral health, and the insights gained from
  this effort. The authors share the importance of using a human-centered
  approach in developing AI tools for mental health care, as well as the
  potential for these tools to improve access to care, reduce stigma, and
  enhance treatment outcomes.

The use of Augmented Intelligence (AI) is one of the most promising technological achievements for chronic behavioral healthcare. The problem is big. It’s complex and vastly under-resourced. Behavioral health, both chronic substance use and mental health, contributes to a whopping 60% of the total cost of health care. Solving this problem is going to need big, novel ideas to solve it.

As a philanthropist and private equity investor, I’ve put AI into practice for over 20 years serving millions of consumers. I studied it at MIT and Harvard. Through my associations there, I’ve had some eye-opening epiphanies and made my share of mistakes. In my case, it wasn’t until 2021, when we were among a very small number of companies to workbench the earliest version of GPT, or “generative pre-trained transformer”, that my team took a deep interest in behavioral health. Why we did it is a long story. But, it is now clear behavioral health is one of the most interesting uses of this technology. Today, the world has been introduced to its simpler consumer version, GPTChat, and the world will have the chance to taste its power.
